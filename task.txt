Practical Task: Supabase + React (TypeScript) Offline-First Workflow

This practical task is designed to evaluate your ability to build an offline-first workflow using Supabase authentication, React (with TypeScript), and IndexedDB/local storage for offline data. The goal is to implement login/register functionality with Supabase Auth and build a workflow to manage Projects → Packages → Reports that can work offline and sync automatically when the database is online.

Requirements
1. **Authentication**
Implement Login and Register using Supabase Auth (email + password).
Store authentication state locally so users stay logged in.

2. **Workflow (Offline + Online Sync)**
Entities:
• Project → Fields: id, project_name
• Package → Fields: id, name, description, project_id
• Report → Fields: id, name, description, package_id
The workflow is: Create Project → Add Packages under Project → Add Reports under Package.
Users should be able to create these items offline (stored in IndexedDB).
Once the internet is available, offline data must sync automatically with Supabase tables.

3. **Listing UI**
Display Projects, Packages, and Reports in a nested card format:
• Project Card → List of Packages inside → Reports under each Package.
